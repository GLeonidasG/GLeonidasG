# Hello there, I'm Le√¥nidas

I am a software engineer and fullstack web developer, currently working on a project with NodeJs + Typescript and Typeorm on the backend, React on frontend and React Native on mobile.

I am currently learning Flutter and Vue and have some interest on learning DevOps with GitHub CI or GitLab CI/CD.
